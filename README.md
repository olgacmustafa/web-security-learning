# Web Security Learning Repository

This repository contains **educational and authorized web security lab write-ups**.
It documents my hands-on learning journey in **web application security**
through structured and ethical lab-based assessments.

All activities were performed in **legal training environments** such as
dedicated security labs and simulations.

## Repository Structure

Each lab write-up includes the following sections:

- **Overview** – Scope and objective of the lab  
- **Exploitation / Methodology** – How the vulnerability was identified and exploited  
- **Impact / Results** – Security impact and achieved access  
- **Mitigation** – Recommended defensive measures  
- **Lessons Learned** – Key takeaways from the lab  

This structure emphasizes **understanding and reasoning** over tool usage
or exploit dumping.
