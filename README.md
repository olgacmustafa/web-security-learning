# Web Security Learning Repository

This repository contains **authorized and educational web security lab write-ups**.
It documents my hands-on learning journey in **web application security** through
structured, ethical, and lab-based assessments.

All activities were performed exclusively in **legal training environments**
such as dedicated security labs, simulations, and intentionally vulnerable systems.

## Topics Covered

- SQL Injection
- Brute Force Attacks
- File Upload Vulnerabilities
- Authentication Bypass
- Remote Code Execution (RCE)
- Server-Side Vulnerabilities
- File Inclusion Issues (LFI/RFI)

## Labs Included

### 🐝 Bee Machine (Hackviser)
- SQL Injection leading to authentication bypass
- Insecure file upload vulnerability
- Remote Code Execution through vulnerability chaining

### 🐍 Discover Lernaean (Hackviser)
- Network and service enumeration
- Directory discovery
- Abuse of default credentials
- SSH brute-force attack

Additional labs focus on real-world web vulnerability classes and attack chains.

## Repository Structure

Each lab write-up follows a clear and consistent structure:

- **Overview** – Scope, objective, and attack surface  
- **Methodology** – Reconnaissance and vulnerability identification approach  
- **Exploitation** – Step-by-step exploitation of identified weaknesses  
- **Impact / Results** – Security impact and achieved level of access  
- **Mitigation** – Recommended defensive and secure coding measures  
- **Lessons Learned** – Key technical and conceptual takeaways  

This structure emphasizes **understanding root causes and attack logic**
rather than simple tool usage or exploit dumping.
