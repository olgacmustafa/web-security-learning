## Mitigation Recommendations

- Implement rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- Enforce account lockout after multiple failed attempts
- Use CAPTCHA after several failures
- Encourage strong, unique passwords

These controls significantly reduce the effectiveness
of brute-force attacks.
