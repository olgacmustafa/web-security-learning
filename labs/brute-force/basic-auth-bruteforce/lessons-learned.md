## Lessons Learned

- Brute-force attacks often succeed due to weak or default credentials
- Publicly documented software configurations pose serious risks
- Directory enumeration is a critical step in reconnaissance
- SSH services require additional hardening beyond default settings
- Brute-force attacks are often part of a larger attack chain

This lab highlighted the importance of layered security
and proactive defense mechanisms.
