## Mitigation Strategies

To prevent brute-force attacks and unauthorized access,
the following security controls should be implemented:

- Enforce strong password policies
- Disable default credentials in applications
- Implement SSH rate limiting
- Use key-based authentication for SSH
- Monitor and log authentication attempts
- Restrict access to administrative interfaces

These measures significantly reduce the effectiveness
of brute-force attacks.
