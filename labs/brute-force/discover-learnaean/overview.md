## Overview

This lab is based on the **Discover Lernaean** machine provided by Hackviser
and focuses on brute-force attacks and weak authentication mechanisms.

The target system exposes multiple services, including:
- Apache HTTP Server
- SSH service

The objective of this lab was to:
- Perform reconnaissance and service enumeration
- Discover hidden web directories
- Identify weak or default credentials
- Conduct an SSH brute-force attack
- Gain authenticated access to the system

All activities were performed in an authorized training environment.
