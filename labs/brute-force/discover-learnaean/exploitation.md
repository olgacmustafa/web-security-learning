## Exploitation

### Directory Enumeration
Directory brute-forcing revealed a hidden path hosting
a file management application.

The application was identified as **Tiny File Manager**,
a commonly used open-source file management solution.

### Credential Discovery
Reviewing the official documentation of the application
revealed the existence of default credentials.

These credentials were tested and successfully authenticated,
granting access to the underlying file system.

### SSH Brute-Force
After enumerating system users through accessible files,
a valid username was identified.

A controlled brute-force attack was conducted against the SSH service
using a common password list, resulting in successful authentication.
