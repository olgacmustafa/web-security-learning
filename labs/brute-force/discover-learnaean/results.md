## Results

The brute-force attack against the SSH service was successful,
leading to authenticated access to the target system.

After login, it was possible to:
- Access the user environment
- Review command execution history
- Confirm system-level access

This demonstrated that weak password policies combined with
exposed services can lead to full system compromise.
