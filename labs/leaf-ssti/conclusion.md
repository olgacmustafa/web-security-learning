# Conclusion

This lab demonstrated how a simple SSTI vulnerability can escalate
into full remote code execution.

Understanding template engines and their evaluation behavior is
critical for both attackers and defenders.

Leaf provides a solid foundation for learning advanced SSTI exploitation
techniques in real-world applications.
