## Exploitation

### SQL Injection Discovery
The login functionality was tested for SQL Injection by manipulating
user-controlled input fields.

An SQL syntax error was observed when special characters were introduced,
indicating unsanitized input being passed directly to the backend query.

### Authentication Bypass
By injecting a logical condition that always evaluates to TRUE,
the authentication mechanism was bypassed, granting access to the admin panel.

### File Upload Exploitation
Inside the admin panel, a file upload feature was discovered.
Testing revealed that file type validation was insufficient.

This allowed the upload and execution of a server-side script,
leading to remote command execution within the lab scope.
