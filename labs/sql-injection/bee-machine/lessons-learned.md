## Lessons Learned

- Client-side validation alone is not sufficient
- SQL Injection remains one of the most critical web vulnerabilities
- File upload functionality is a high-risk feature if misconfigured
- Chaining vulnerabilities greatly increases overall impact

This lab reinforced the importance of secure coding practices
and defense-in-depth strategies.
