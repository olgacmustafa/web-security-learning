## Lessons Learned

- File upload functionality is one of the most dangerous features
  in web applications when improperly secured
- Client-side validation cannot be trusted
- Authentication bypass combined with file upload vulnerabilities
  significantly increases overall impact
- Vulnerability chaining plays a critical role in real-world attacks

This lab highlighted the importance of secure file handling
and defense-in-depth strategies in web application security.
