## Exploitation

### Vulnerability Discovery
Within the admin panel, a profile image upload feature was identified.
Initial testing showed that the application did not properly validate
the type or content of uploaded files.

To confirm the vulnerability, a non-image file was uploaded successfully,
indicating that server-side file validation was insufficient.

### Exploitation Method
After confirming the lack of validation, a server-side script was uploaded
through the file upload functionality.

The application stored uploaded files in a web-accessible directory
and allowed their execution, leading to **remote command execution**
within the scope of the lab environment.

### Impact
By exploiting this vulnerability, it was possible to:
- Execute system commands
- Enumerate system information
- Access sensitive application files

This vulnerability, when combined with prior authentication bypass,
resulted in full application compromise.
