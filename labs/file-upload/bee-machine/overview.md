## Overview

This lab focuses on an **insecure file upload vulnerability**
identified in an authorized Hackviser training environment.

After gaining access to the admin panel, a file upload functionality
was discovered in the user settings section of the application.

The objective of this lab was to:
- Analyze the file upload mechanism
- Identify insufficient validation controls
- Exploit the vulnerability to achieve remote code execution (RCE)

This scenario demonstrates how file upload features can become
critical attack vectors when proper security controls are missing.
