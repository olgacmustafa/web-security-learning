# Bee Machine – File Upload Lab

This directory contains the write-up for an **insecure file upload vulnerability**
identified in the Bee Machine lab on Hackviser.

## Scope
The lab focuses on how insufficient server-side validation in file upload
functionality can lead to **remote code execution (RCE)**.

## Write-Up Structure
The vulnerability is documented using the following sections:

- **Overview** – Lab context and objective
- **Exploitation** – Vulnerability discovery and exploitation logic
- **Mitigation** – Recommended security controls
- **Lessons Learned** – Key takeaways from the lab

This lab demonstrates how file upload vulnerabilities can be combined
with other weaknesses, such as authentication bypass, to fully compromise
a web application.
